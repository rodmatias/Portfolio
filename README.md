# [Project 1: Wonderful Wines of the World](https://github.com/rodmatias/WWW_Customer_Segmentation)

**Problem type:** Customer Segmentation

## General Context

Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new
customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers.
Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of
customers that have different product interests, different market
participation, or different response to marketing efforts.

Market segmentation, the process of identifying customers’ groups, makes use
of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of
customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments,
organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product
definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.

# [Project 2: Hotel Cancelations Prediction](https://github.com/rodmatias/Cancelations_Prediction)

**Problem type:** Classification

## General Context

Cancellations occur for understandable reasons such as business meeting
changes, vacations rescheduling, illness, or adverse weather conditions.
However, cancellations also occur for not so understandable reasons, such as
finding a better deal. “Deal-seeking” customers, tend to make multiple
bookings for the same trip or make one booking, but continue to search for
better deals (e.g., looking for hotels with better social reputation, better
price, or better location)

2. Prediction using Random Forest algorithm
3. Suggestion of model productionizing
4. Presentation to the board members of the company
